// The dead-end finder (#515): every reachable non-terminal state must have an
// exit. Each case restarts the real controller from an enumerated state (see
// test/support/dead-ends.mjs) and fails if the Objective is stranded: the
// restart neither progresses nor completes, and following the commands the
// status names does not continue it.
//
// Known dead ends are inverted, like the fault matrix's known failures: the
// test passes while the state stays stranded for its diagnosed reason and fails
// once it has an exit; then remove its entry. Entries name a state by its
// structure — delivery, anchor shape, overlays — and are checked whether or
// not the pairwise sample picks them.
