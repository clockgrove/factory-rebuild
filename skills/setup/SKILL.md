description: Install and bind one Factory configuration to a target GitHub repository and checkout without starting Objective execution.

# Factory setup

Confirm the target is a Git repository outside all Factory source, rebuild, and archive repositories. Obtain the operator's positive concurrency choice, repository `OWNER/REPO`, absolute checkout path, regular or native-stack delivery choice, and any requested planner, reviewer, or worker Codex model/reasoning selections. Keep credentials outside repositories. Use `factory install --repository OWNER/REPO --checkout ABSOLUTE_PATH --concurrency N` with `--delivery native-stack` only when requested. Pass role selections with `--planning-model`, `--planning-reasoning`, `--review-model`, `--review-reasoning`, `--worker-model`, and `--worker-reasoning`. If the operator does not choose them, state that Factory will persist its explicit per-role default of `gpt-5.6-sol` with `medium` reasoning. Report the installed binding and configuration path printed by the CLI. Do not start work during setup.

Factory requires an empty configuration and state root at installation; use a fresh `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME` for an isolated trial. Preserve GitHub CLI authentication by setting `GH_CONFIG_DIR` to its existing configuration directory before changing `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. `factory install` validates and persists every selected model and reasoning value; it does not inherit the operator's ambient Codex model settings. `factory plan` requires an authenticated Codex SDK environment. Local execution through the Codex SDK is the implemented production shape. Managed-agent and sandbox shapes are reserved; report their unsupported result until their branches ship. The target repository remains authoritative for its instructions and validation.
