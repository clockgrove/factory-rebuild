# Changelog

This file records public releases of Factory. See [BUILD-STATUS.md](docs/BUILD-STATUS.md) for development acceptance evidence.

## 0.1.17 — 2026-09-25

- Retry classified provider-capacity failures twice for graph, Work Item result, and final Objective review while preserving the selected reviewer model, reasoning, exact prompt, and schema.
- Record each bounded provider attempt and delay independently in diagnostics without replaying workers, validation, planning, or delivery.
- Keep non-capacity failures and exhausted capacity fail-closed through the existing exact human-decision path, with method-authoritative review phases controlling retry and diagnostic attribution.

## 0.1.16 — 2026-09-25

- Align the installed setup skill with the independent runtime defaults for planner, reviewer, and worker model selections.
- Check the packaged setup guidance against the installed runtime default exports during the offline packed-artifact smoke.

## 0.1.15 — 2026-09-25

- Require every streamed provider turn to emit an explicit successful terminal event; classify premature stream exhaustion or interruption instead of treating it as completion.
- Bound planning, review, and detached worker turns with one shared 15-minute reset-on-real-event idle watchdog that does not depend on provider SDK abort cooperation.
- Close provider iterators on terminal paths with bounded cleanup while preserving the authoritative provider failure, and durably record timeout or interruption failures without result evidence.

## 0.1.14 — 2026-09-25

- Emit controller-owned capture receipts only after Factory verifies every complete candidate member beneath `.factory-media/`, and bind optional `.factory-assets.json` provenance only after a descriptor-based regular-file read matches the harness declaration exactly.
- Emit controller-owned selection receipts with fixed CLI/application invocation provenance, selected-set identity, exact destinations, actor, time, optional reason, and downstream bindings.
- Bound every authoritative receipt and selected-asset review observation to its validated schema, strip unknown persisted claims, preserve provider-neutral non-manifest harnesses and documented harness metadata, and treat absent legacy evidence as non-proof.

## 0.1.13 — 2026-09-25

- Hydrate only the selected required-LFS members from Factory's verified local content store into exact-tree validation worktrees, verify their committed pointer and restored SHA-256/size before target commands, and fail closed before command zero when local selected bytes are missing or corrupt.
- Reverify selected bytes after validation and compare the final worktree state with its controller-hydrated baseline, preserving clean-tree enforcement without globally enabling Git LFS smudging or fetching from the network.
- Strengthen the regular/native application gate so both Work Item and final Objective validation must hash the exact selected content rather than merely accept a non-empty LFS pointer.

## 0.1.12 — 2026-09-25

- Bind planning and independent graph review to a canonical installed-artifact manifest of controller-enforced media and Git LFS guarantees, rejecting edited or stale capability identities before activation.
- Let the controller migrate an explicitly captured repository asset from an ordinary Git blob to required Git LFS at the same path only when the selected, captured, and current bytes are identical; workers may not mutate final asset destinations.
- Verify post-integration fresh-clone hydration before final Objective review, persist an exact commit/tree/member receipt that the reviewer can cite and resumed state must reproduce, and bound clone/LFS failures without exposing origin URLs.

## 0.1.11 — 2026-09-25

- Default planner and reviewer execution to `gpt-5.6-sol` with medium reasoning, and Work Item execution to `gpt-5.6-luna` with medium reasoning, while preserving independent explicit overrides for every role.
- Stream provider-neutral diagnostics for compile and review model invocations, preserving explicit model policy, provider progress, supplied token/cache usage, safe request/response digests, and parse or semantic rejection reasons.
- Add `factory diagnostics --summary` with per-Objective, phase, and invocation-scope counts, explicit unavailable usage, available token totals, and cache-read numerator/denominator.
- Constrain graph-review finding sources to the exact supplied path enum so heading-qualified aliases cannot produce invalid independent-review evidence.
- Reject every malformed graph-review finding with its exact field path and bounded reason while preserving clean `{"findings":[]}` as the unambiguous no-defect result; private diagnostics never copy provider quotes or unknown source labels.

## 0.1.10 — 2026-09-24

- Ground final Objective acceptance in bounded, supervisor-generated per-Work-Item Git deltas tied to exact result and integration identities.
- Exclude nested Work Item reviewer prose from final review while preserving canonical command receipts, selected-asset facts, and exact source quotations.
- Fail closed on truncated or identity-inconsistent evidence and preserve every rejected final-review candidate with its field-level rejection reason.

## 0.1.9 — 2026-09-24

- Bind every ordered validation-command receipt to its exact result tree, stable index, and successful exit code for Work Item and final Objective review.
- Name result and integrated commit/tree identities separately in reviewer observations, and explicitly teach the reviewer that Git commits and trees are different object types.
- Move durable run state to schemaVersion 2 and reject missing, misordered, cross-tree, or command-substituted receipts before resumed state can be trusted.

## 0.1.8 — 2026-09-23

- Review the complete proposed plan, including command-authority receipts and exact final integrated-head commands, rather than only the inner Work Item graph.
- Bind the canonical plan packet, independent review result, and installation configuration to schemaVersion 2 planning candidates and exact-digest human decisions.
- Activate an unchanged accepted preview with deterministic verification and no second planning-review model call; reject stale, configuration-drifted, or review-tampered candidates before GitHub projection.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-09-23

- Persist explicit, independently selectable Codex model and reasoning choices for planning, review, and Work Item execution instead of inheriting ambient user configuration.
- Supply result review with the accepted graph's owned paths and named resources for each relevant attempt, so disjoint scheduling criteria can be proved from bounded authoritative observations.
- Add installed-package, adapter-routing, configuration-validation, and exact resource-observation regressions for the v0.1.6 public-gate failures.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-09-23

- Supply Work Item review with each relevant attempt's validated result head so a native successor can prove its exact predecessor base before the stack is integrated.
- Add bounded runner-derived delivery context: regular delivery, or native unit identity, one-based layer number/count, and immediate predecessor item.
- Add focused observation coverage and a three-layer temporary-Git regression that proves the second and third native layers without result decisions.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-09-23

- Persist the immutable worker execution base and integration head observed at attempt start; native replay advances only the mutable validation and delivery base.
- Label legacy missing start provenance explicitly in Work Item review observations instead of inferring it from later delivery state.
- Add a focused replay-versus-attempt unit regression and a staggered native temporary-Git scenario in which one concurrent root integrates before its peer is reviewed.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-09-23

- Supply Work Item result review with a bounded scheduling-provenance packet derived from the authoritative atomic snapshot and accepted graph.
- Ground exact attempt, start-time, execution-base, dependency, peer-start, and integration-state findings in `Delivery observations`, while preserving criterion-specific human fallback for missing or contradictory evidence.
- Add temporary-Git concurrent-root and negative provenance regressions, plus persisted attempt start-time validation.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-09-23

- Turn an invalid independent graph-review response into an explicit planning decision on the pinned graph, never a clean automated pass.
- Let a recorded human acceptance of that exact graph proceed without repeating the malformed review; refusal still stops activation.
- Add temporary-Git planning and application regressions for the paused and accepted paths.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-09-23

- Keep result-review findings independent per acceptance criterion, so one malformed citation cannot erase separate valid proofs.
- Accept only exact quotes from pinned source, the supplied Git change packet, exact-tree command-pass evidence, or delivery observations. Retain human fallback for missing evidence and truncated result text.
- Add temporary-Git regressions for evidence-backed automatic passes and an unsupported finding that pauses only its own criterion.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-23

- Allow an Objective to create a pnpm workspace and run its exactly source-declared bootstrap, check, and test commands at the validated result tree.
- Keep pre-existing scripts pinned to the Objective base, pin newly established scripts to later Work Item predecessors, and reject new lifecycle hooks or nested package-manager wrappers.
- Backfill the `v0.1.0` exact-public-artifact acceptance record and require a new installed-artifact gate before the Clockgrove pilot.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-23

- Compile pinned repository Objectives into reviewed Work Item DAGs with independently admitted validation commands and exact-tree acceptance decisions.
- Run local Codex SDK attempts through concurrent regular pull requests or native linear stacks, with restart, cancellation, explicit retry, and verified GitHub closure.
- Preserve human-selected media AssetSets, structured source bindings, target-owned Git LFS policy, and changed-file safety checks before publication.
- Expose private agent-readable status, diagnostics, and worker output without using logs as lifecycle authority.
- Add the public Clockgrove Git marketplace, bundled Linux x64 CLI tarball, packaged use skills, community policies, and third-party license notices.
