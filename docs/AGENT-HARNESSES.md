# Local agent harnesses

Factory owns the Objective lifecycle. A local `AgentHarness` owns only one Work
Item attempt inside the exact worktree supplied by Factory. Codex is the default
harness; the source candidate also contains pinned Claude Agent SDK and GitHub
Copilot SDK adapters and a package-root registration seam for another adapter.

Planning and independent result review remain on the configured Codex SDK
models. Selecting Claude or GitHub Copilot changes only Work Item execution.

This is the unreleased `0.1.22` candidate interface, not a capability claim for
the immutable public `v0.1.21` package. Credential-free checks do not qualify a
real provider or authorize a live attempt.

## Capability contract

Every harness must declare this exact capability record before composition:

```ts
{
  protocolVersion: 1,
  worktree: "factory-owned-read-write",
  head: "preserve",
  lifecycle: "restart-safe-durable-handle",
  publication: "controller-only",
  assetSets: true,
  authentication: "local-environment" | "adapter-owned" | "none"
}
```

At runtime, `observe` may return a typed local-login request alongside the
failure detail. Built-in `collect` implementations propagate that request and
the runners persist it in Work Item state, so both human-readable and JSON
`factory status` output identify the provider and login command:

```ts
{
  state: "failed",
  detail: "Authentication required ...",
  authentication: { provider: "...", command: "..." }
}
```

Factory rejects a harness with incompatible capabilities. A conforming harness:

- operates only in the supplied Factory-owned worktree and leaves `HEAD`
  unchanged;
- does not commit, push, deploy, open or edit issues or pull requests, or
  receive the controller's GitHub publication credentials;
- returns a non-empty attempt identity plus JSON-safe durable handle data;
- supports restart-safe `observe`, `cancel`, and `collect` without creating a
  second ambiguous attempt;
- returns only normalized evidence and declared `AssetSet` candidates; and
- treats provider completion as an untrusted candidate result. Factory still
  checks owned paths and secrets, validates the exact result tree, performs
  independent acceptance review, publishes, and validates the integrated
  Objective.

The stable adapter identity and exact adapter-owned configuration are part of
Factory's configuration digest. Active local handles are also bound to that
identity. A missing registration, identity mismatch, configuration mismatch, or
mid-run configuration change stops instead of falling back to Codex or another
harness.

## Installed registration seam

An adapter package imports only the package root. It does not construct or
replace Factory's driver, scheduler, validator, GitHub gateway, delivery
strategy, planning models, or content store:

```ts
import {
  composeWithLocalHarness,
  type AgentHarness,
  type FactoryConfig,
} from "@clockgrove/factory";

const identity = "example/acme-agent@2";
const adapterConfig = {
  model: "acme-code-1",
  session: "new-per-attempt",
};

const harness: AgentHarness = {
  capabilities: {
    protocolVersion: 1,
    worktree: "factory-owned-read-write",
    head: "preserve",
    lifecycle: "restart-safe-durable-handle",
    publication: "controller-only",
    assetSets: true,
    authentication: "adapter-owned",
  },
  async start(request) {
    // Start once in request.worktree. Persist provider identity in `data`.
    return { identity: request.attemptId!, data: { providerTask: "..." } };
  },
  async observe(handle) {
    return { state: "running" };
  },
  async cancel(handle) {},
  async collect(handle) {
    return { evidence: { adapter: identity } };
  },
};

const config: FactoryConfig = {
  // ...ordinary Factory installation fields...
  execution: {
    kind: "local",
    concurrency: 1,
    harness: {
      kind: "registered",
      adapter: identity,
      config: adapterConfig,
    },
  },
};

const factory = composeWithLocalHarness(config, {
  identity,
  config: adapterConfig,
  harness,
});
await factory.runObjective(123);
```

The adapter owns the meaning and validation of its opaque JSON-safe config. A
behavior-changing adapter release should use a new stable identity. Factory
schema version 1 selects one harness for an Objective; mixed harnesses and
automatic fallback are intentionally unsupported.

Factory names the shared selection `reasoningEffort` for all three built-ins.
The Claude adapter maps that field to the Claude SDK's provider-native `effort`
option; provider vocabulary does not leak into persisted Factory configuration.

The two optional SDK packages are declared as exact optional package
dependencies. A normal online npm installation installs them. An installation
using `--omit=optional` can still use Codex and the generic registered seam, but
cannot select the Claude or GitHub Copilot built-in adapter.

Factory's default Codex and Claude paths retain Node.js 22.0.0 or later. The
exact Copilot SDK `1.0.13` dependency requires Node.js 22.12.0 or later on
Factory's supported Node range. Selecting it on Node 22.0–22.11 fails before
SDK loading, authentication or an attempt; there is no fallback or automatic
installation. Optional-omitted installations retain the default/root seam at
Factory's Node floor.

Building and checking distribution notices requires a full dependency install:
the generator reads the installed optional SDK license texts. That contributor
prerequisite does not make either SDK necessary for an optional-omitted runtime.

Each built-in worker records a correlated usage invocation before provider
startup, requires an explicit successful terminal event, and bounds idle waits
and cleanup using the existing provider-turn guard. Copilot checks its observed startup worktree,
model and any supplied reasoning effort before sending the accepted Work Item
prompt; missing startup evidence or a mismatch fails before dispatch. Progress
resets only the idle timer, retaining the timeout promise observed by any active
provider operation. These guards do not add a retry or execution-time budget.
Codex exposes only its supplied normalized counters. Claude and Copilot deliberately report normalized
worker token usage as unavailable in this candidate: Claude's cache/input
semantics differ from Codex, and Copilot conversation/context counters are not
API usage. Safe provider-reported raw fields may remain in private evidence;
summaries do not infer totals, cache ratios, or zero usage from those fields.

All three built-in harnesses reuse the developer's local authentication. Factory
does not add tokens to its configuration file. For example, an existing `codex`
CLI login is visible to the Codex SDK worker, an existing Claude profile is
visible to the Claude worker, and the Copilot SDK is started with
`useLoggedInUser: true` against the developer's local Copilot state. The worker
environment excludes controller publication variables such as `GH_TOKEN` and
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. Copilot retains the worker-owned empty `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, even if
the controller sets a different directory or uses HOME/XDG defaults. Its
controller `gh` publication login is not supplied as a Copilot auth source.
The explicitly selected local-auth adapter may use its Copilot-local profile or
named Copilot auth environment; missing login fails with the existing actionable
login-and-explicit-retry request rather than restoring the controller's store.
The pinned SDK's `empty` mode disables keytar; Factory does not claim that this
mode will reuse a system-keychain login. Provider-local state does not authorize
ambient tools, plugins, settings discovery, memory, or session persistence.

If a profile is missing or expired, the attempt fails durably with a specific
request to authenticate in the developer environment:

```sh
codex login
claude auth login
copilot
```

After login, the operator explicitly starts a fresh unpublished attempt:

```sh
factory retry --objective ISSUE_NUMBER --item WORK_ITEM_ID
factory run --objective ISSUE_NUMBER
```

Factory never opens an interactive credential prompt inside a detached worker,
stores the resulting credential in run state, or silently changes provider.

## CLI selection

Codex remains the default when `--harness` is omitted. The current source
candidate can install either optional adapter explicitly:

```sh
factory install \
  --repository OWNER/REPO --checkout /absolute/target --concurrency 1 \
  --harness claude-agent-sdk \
  --worker-model CLAUDE_MODEL --worker-reasoning medium \
  --claude-max-turns 12

factory install \
  --repository OWNER/REPO --checkout /absolute/target --concurrency 1 \
  --harness github-copilot-sdk \
  --worker-model COPILOT_MODEL --worker-reasoning medium \
  --copilot-timeout-seconds 900
```

Claude defaults to `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, and `Grep`. GitHub Copilot
defaults to `view`, `create`, `edit`, `grep`, and `glob`. Repeated
`--claude-tool`, `--claude-allow-tool`, and `--copilot-tool` flags make those
sets explicit. Claude setting sources are empty by default; each allowed source
requires a repeated `--claude-setting-source` flag. Provider-specific fields do
not cross adapters.

## Security boundary and acceptance

These are local processes running as the developer's OS account. Worktree path
checks, SDK permission callbacks, filtered environments, and disabled extension
surfaces reduce accidental authority; they are not an OS sandbox for hostile
repository code. Source-authorized validation commands also run locally under
operator authority. Managed agents, remote Copilot sessions, sandbox execution,
Daytona, dynamic provider installation, and a provider marketplace are outside
this seam.

Credential-free CI packs Factory, installs it while omitting optional packages,
imports only `@clockgrove/factory`, injects a scripted non-Codex harness, and
runs a complete one-item path through the production local driver, exact-tree
validation, regular delivery, and final validation. Real provider acceptance is
separate: Codex, Claude, and GitHub Copilot must run the same bounded disposable
target from the exact packed artifact. Those live calls require explicit
operator authorization and available provider access; deterministic CI does not
claim that proof.
