# Source provenance

The clean implementation starts from the Factory plan reviewed September 22, 2026. The archived source at `clockgrove/factory` commit `994bbfcadb317aed2dfa932ec9d128e7d0d8c7a8` is reference material only. No runtime source, test, fixture, snapshot, or generated artifact was copied into the clean implementation.

The MIT license text is retained from the archived repository. Runtime code does not read this ledger.

## Trunk issue #24 — changed-file safety

Inspected the archived `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`, `src/runtime/pinned-git-environment.ts`, and `src/execution/artifacts.ts` at commit `994bbfcadb317aed2dfa932ec9d128e7d0d8c7a8`. The clean local driver retains exact-base collection, pinned Git environment, changed-path ownership, and the trusted-local worker boundary. It checks staged candidate modes and traversal, rejects newly introduced special entries, scans only changed staged and working bytes with maintained Secretlint rules, and filters the worker's effective environment to a small ambient allowlist. The archived artifact protocol, blanket file-size/count limits, receipt machinery, and claim of hostile-code containment were not retained. A reviewed operator-owned Secretlint config outside the target checkout is the explicit false-positive path.

## Slice 3 extraction

The same audited commit supplied the delivery checklist. GitHub's current versioned stack and asynchronous merge API was also checked against official documentation before implementation. The clean delivery code retains only the behavior needed by regular and immutable native linear PR paths.

## Slice 4 extraction

The same audited commit supplied the media and LFS checklist. The clean implementation uses one local content-addressed store, one harness-declared AssetSet result, and the existing Work Item delivery path. No archived media orchestrator, receipt protocol, or test was copied.

Trunk gap #23 extends that clean media path with structured-only source bindings, authorized local and recognized Objective attachment ingress, durable selection decisions, and explicit downstream bindings. The new work stays in the same content store, local driver, and ordinary validation/delivery path. It adds no media producer, catalog, or second orchestrator; model/tool/request/parameter details are retained only if a harness or authoritative tool supplies them.

## Deterministic integration suite

The application integration tests were written from the current public acceptance criteria and controlling contracts. No archived test, fixture, helper, snapshot, transcript, or qualification protocol was inspected or copied for them. They use current public target inputs, temporary Git repositories and worktrees, a scripted planning/harness adapter, and a small domain-level GitHub fake.

## GitHub projection and completion hardening

Issue #22 reuses the existing clean GitHub projection and delivery code named above. No additional archived path, state format, test, or recovery protocol was consulted or copied. The completion changes follow the public issue acceptance: marker-based Work Item reconciliation, dependency checks, PR identity verification, and replayable issue/comment closure in the one atomic snapshot. New interruption tests use the current stateful GitHub fake at the application boundary.

## Native dependency waves and retry

Issue #21 extends the clean `src/delivery/native-runner.ts` using the existing `src/scheduler.ts` conflict rule and `src/delivery/plan.ts` unit partition. No additional archived source or test was consulted or copied. New application tests use the current disposable Git target and stateful GitHub fake to prove a post-foundation readiness wave and explicit retry after a terminal native failure.

## Pinned planning and graph review gap (#19)

The audited archive commit's `src/application/plan.ts`, `src/application/compiler-preflight.ts`, and `src/compiler/judge-context.ts` were inspected for the read-only planning boundary, pinned Git authority, and complete independent review packet. The clean `src/compiler.ts`, `src/runner.ts`, and `src/cli.ts` implement only the required current path: exact named sources/headings from the pinned base, a zero-run-state preview, one independent source-backed graph review, at most one automatic revision, and a specific recorded human fallback. The archived policy matrix, repository inventory caps, compiler judge byte cap, obligation inventory, and recovery protocols were not copied.

## Agent-readable diagnostics (#28)

The public plan and issue #28 supplied this slice's behavior. No archived telemetry source, log format, or recovery journal was inspected or copied. The clean `src/diagnostics.ts` reads snapshot-derived status and appends private observations; `src/validation.ts` captures actual command output and `src/execution/worker.ts` records SDK stream events when supplied. These local records are never read for continuation, replay, or scheduling.

## Planning and review model telemetry (#73)

Issue #73, the current clean model/configuration contracts, and the installed `@openai/codex-sdk` event and usage types supplied this correction. Official Codex SDK and App Server documentation was consulted to confirm the supported streamed event and usage concepts; no archived Factory telemetry, prompt journal, billing model, retry policy, or provider-specific lifecycle state was inspected or copied. The clean implementation adds one provider-neutral observation contract, translates current Codex events inside `CodexPlanningModel`, and emits only safe identities, counts, timestamps, and digests through the existing private diagnostics sink. Raw prompts, source packets, and responses remain outside exportable metadata, and diagnostics remain observational rather than continuation truth.

## Bounded reviewer-capacity retry (#94)

Issue #94, the preserved fresh installed v0.1.16 qualification diagnostics, and the current clean model-observation and acceptance contracts supplied this correction. No archived retry policy, provider fallback, state format, or test was inspected or copied. The clean adapter retries only the same selected reviewer after a classified provider-capacity failure, reusing the exact in-memory structured request with two bounded delays. Attempt metadata remains observational; the atomic snapshot is still the only continuation truth. Non-capacity failures and exhausted capacity retain the existing fail-closed decision path.

## Manifest provenance capture receipt (#99)

Issue #99, the preserved fresh installed v0.1.17 qualification state, and the current clean media, atomic-state, and review-observation contracts supplied this correction. No archived receipt format, provenance protocol, state schema, prompt, or test was inspected or copied. The clean change extends the existing controller capture receipt with an exact clone of the provenance declaration already parsed from `.factory-assets.json`, validates that clone against the captured AssetSet on state ingress, and projects only the validated fields into result-review observations. Harness-declared selected-asset metadata remains separately labeled and absence of the controller fields proves nothing.

## Imported source identity capture receipt (#102)

Issue #102, the preserved fresh installed v0.1.18 qualification state, and the current clean source-import, media-capture, atomic-state, and review-observation contracts supplied this correction. No archived receipt format, content-transfer protocol, state schema, prompt, or test was inspected or copied. The clean change clones each controller-imported source binding and content ref into the existing capture receipt, validates the ordered clone against the captured AssetSet on state ingress, and projects only those bounded identities to result review. Matching input and member digest, byte count, and media type can therefore prove identity of the exact imported bytes; harness-declared fields and absence of a controller input receipt prove nothing.

## Graph-review rejection diagnostics (#76)

Issue #76, the live #55 qualification evidence, and the current graph-review and diagnostic contracts supplied this correction. No archived reviewer parser, error format, prompt journal, or test was inspected or copied. The clean validator rejects each malformed field independently, emits only its bounded path and fixed reason plus an exact recognized supplied-source label when available, and preserves the existing fail-closed human-decision path. Provider quotes, details, questions, and unknown source text remain outside diagnostic metadata. The prompt and focused current-repository tests also establish an empty findings array as the only clean no-defect result.

## Command trust and result acceptance (#20)

The clean implementation extends `src/compiler.ts`, `src/validation.ts`, and the existing regular/native runners from the public #20 acceptance and current #19 planning contract. No additional archived source, test, state format, or validator protocol was inspected or copied. Command authority is checked against pinned source lines or a named tracked base file; selected npm/pnpm scripts and lifecycle hooks are compared with the accepted base before execution, while unrelated package metadata remains editable. One exact script-disabled pnpm bootstrap form provisions a fresh validation worktree from a tracked lockfile. Result review uses one exact-tree packet with text diffs and blob descriptors and one specific human fallback, with decisions in the existing atomic snapshot. There is no judge loop or secondary validation ledger.

## Explicit Codex phase selection follow-up

After the v0.1.6 public gate exposed ambient Codex reasoning inheritance, the archived `src/protocol/policy.ts` at commit `994bbfcadb317aed2dfa932ec9d128e7d0d8c7a8` was inspected for its named model-profile behavior. The archive bound `compile`, `implement`, `review`, and `recover` phases to explicit model/reasoning profiles, but its shipped run policy constrained new runs to one shared profile and included broader provider/economics machinery. No archived implementation was copied. The clean correction keeps model policy inside the current Codex SDK adapters, exposes independent planner, reviewer, and worker selections, writes explicit Factory defaults, and retains the generic `AgentHarness` and execution contracts unchanged.

## Role-specific Factory defaults (#59)

Issue #59 and the current explicit-selection implementation supplied this change. No additional archived source or provider policy was inspected or copied. Factory now resolves planner, reviewer, and worker defaults separately at installation, persists the resulting explicit values, and keeps provider-neutral harness work in issue #55. A post-merge boundary audit rejected a shared-default compatibility alias that was not required by #59; the package root exposes only the role-specific defaults.

## Controller media guarantees and same-path LFS migration (#81)

Issue #81 and the current public compiler, media, delivery, validation, and atomic-state contracts supplied this correction. No additional archived source, test, receipt format, or media protocol was inspected or copied. The clean implementation adds one code-owned versioned controller-capability manifest, a narrowly authorized byte-identical repository-source-to-LFS migration at the same path, and one bounded hydration receipt inside existing final validation evidence. It does not add a second receipt journal, target command authority, provider-specific media behavior, or worker control over final destinations.

The fresh installed v0.1.12 public gate then supplied the validation-worktree correction: its exact content-hash command observed the committed LFS pointer because pinned Git intentionally disabled smudging. The correction extends the same validation and local content-store contracts to verify the committed pointer, restore only selected required-LFS members locally, verify exact bytes before and after commands, and fail before command zero on missing or corrupt content. No archived source, new network authority, global smudge configuration, or pointer-only weakening was used.

The fresh installed v0.1.14 public gate supplied the provider-stream terminal correction. A real result-review provider turn was interrupted after `turn.started`; the SDK event iterator neither produced a terminal event nor ended, so Factory kept the invocation active indefinitely. The correction uses the current SDK `AbortSignal` contract, requires explicit `turn.completed` authority, and applies one reset-on-real-event idle watchdog to both planning/review and detached Work Item turns. It adds no provider-task polling, inferred response, retry policy, lifecycle journal, or archived deadline machinery.

## Controller materialization review evidence (#111)

Issue #111, the preserved fresh installed v0.1.20 result-review packet, and the current clean Git, media-selection, atomic-state, and review-evidence contracts supplied this correction. No archived source, receipt format, state schema, journal, diagnostic record, or qualification implementation was inspected or copied. The clean implementation derives one bounded supervisor evidence source from the validated selected-set state and immutable Git commit graph: the controller materialization commit retains the worker result as its sole parent; exact commit/tree resolution and changed-path checks distinguish the worker delta from the selected-destination-only controller delta. The same source reaches regular/native Work Item review and final Objective review. Existing local collection still rejects final-destination mutation; the new Git evidence describes the delivered worker result and does not claim to trace transient filesystem operations.
